## Remove Phase 5 from Roadmap

A simple update to the roadmap file to remove the Phase 5 (Infrastructure) section entirely, since those items (Cloudflare Analytics, AdSense, sitemap auto-generation, robots.txt AI crawler rules) are not priorities right now.

### Changes

**File: `.lovable/roadmap.md`**
- Delete the entire Phase 5 section (Cloudflare Web Analytics, AdSense, Sitemap auto-generation, robots.txt AI crawler rules)
- Update the "Implementation Order" line to remove the Phase 5 reference
