## Remove `/vs/*` Comparison Pages from Roadmap

The `/vs/*` comparison pages are being dropped as not a good fit for the project.

### Change

**File: `.lovable/roadmap.md`**
- Remove the `/vs/* comparison pages` todo item from Phase 5
- This makes Phase 5 (SEO & Content) fully complete
- Update the Phase 5 table so all items show a checkmark
- The entire roadmap will then be 100% done
